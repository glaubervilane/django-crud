Welcome to the Django CRUD Practice repository! This project serves as a hands-on playground for learning and mastering the Django web framework by implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical, hands-on experience with Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The focus here is on building a simple CRUD application to manage entities and explore the various features offered by Django.

## Features

- **Django Models**: Define data models to represent entities in the application.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for the defined entities.
- **Django Views and Templates**: Create views and templates to handle user interface logic and rendering.
- **Forms**: Utilize Django forms to handle user input for creating and updating entities.
- **Static Files and Media Handling**: Manage static files (CSS, JavaScript) and user-uploaded media files.
- **Database Integration**: Connect to a database, perform migrations, and interact with data.
